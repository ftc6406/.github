Welcome to the GitHub page of FTC Team 6406, FIRST Tech Coyotes!
This is where we keep repositories of our code each season. You can see some of our code from previous years if you go to repositories and click on "[Archived](https://github.com/orgs/chsRobotix/repositories?type=archived)."

# Joining
If you do not already have a GitHub account, [sign up](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home), using your personal email, not your school email. To join the Robotix Team, please contact one of the organization owners. GitHub only allows users to join organizations by invitation, so please include your GitHub username when sending a message. Talking to them in person would probably be easier, but a list of owner emails is provided below just in case.

List of Organization Owners:
- Eric Zhang
